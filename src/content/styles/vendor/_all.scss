/* The vendor directory is for overriding third-party CSS. This is handy when using prepackaged components developed by other people.
jQuery UI and a color picker override styles are examples of CSS that you might want to place in the vendor directory.
This should make it easy to update my third-party stylesheets to more current versions in the future. */
