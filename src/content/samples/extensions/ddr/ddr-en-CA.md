# DDR Publishing Process

The Data Dissemination Repository Publishing Process allows users to publish, update and un-publish map services and FGP authoring tool configuration files.

The DDR service allows users to upload a zip file package (created by users) containing a FGP author conﬁguration ﬁle (conﬁg-ﬁle.json), HTML snippet (to include above or below the map inside the template) and folders (images/help/about folders).

The zip file must be created by a user before uploading a file using the DDR Publishing Process.
