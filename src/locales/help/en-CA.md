# General Information

The Federal Geospatial Platform Author tool is can be used to create, read, validate and preview json format configuration files to be used by the Federal Geospatial Platform Viewer.

A configuration file may be read from an existing file, by clicking on the up arrow icon  ![](uparrow.png).

To created new configuration file, click on the plus sign icon ![](plussign.png).

To save the configuration file once finished, click on the diskette icon ![](diskette.png) .

By default 3 templates that contain default values for your organization when
creating a configuration file are listed. Select either the config-authorA, config-AuthorB or config-full template.

You can change the language of this application by selecting the language at the right upper corner using the pull down list.

# Load Times/Unanticipated Behavior

![](startingwheel.png)

The spinning wheel occurs at the loading of the application and during execution of a file in preview mode.

You can press the F12 function key to enter into debug mode and select
the console tab to obtain additional error messages if execution time takes too long.

Load times for this application and the preview viewer configuration may vary based on:
- network location
- bandwidth availability
- number of layers being loaded
- Layer types and their sizes

Unanticipated behavior may occur if any interactions occur before data is fully loaded. Please allow the webpage to load completely before triggering any functions.
