##### Detailed Information about _Basemaps_ Section

Once the _Extents and Levels of Details_ section is set, it is time to add your basemaps. Depending on the template you are using, maybe most of this section is already filled. If you want to add a new basemap, follow these steps:

1. Add a new basemap with _Add_ button.

2. Enter a unique ID.

3. Enter a name and a description. Those values will show up in the basemaps selector.

4. Link your base map with a _Tile Schema_.

5. Add at least one layer for this basemap
    * Enter a unique ID, the layer type (usually esriFeature) and the URL.

You can reorder the Basemaps at your convenience but keep in mind basemaps are only reorderable inside their own tile schema group. So even if the interface let you mix them up, they will be regroup inside the viewer.
